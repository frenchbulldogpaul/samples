		<h2> About myself </h2>
	</header>
		<p> I was born on September 20th 2013 in Hungary. Until 4 months I lived with my mom and dad brothers and sisters. Once I was told that I needed to leave my family and go away in search of a new family. I was very sad because I missed my parents.My path went south and I ended up in a wonderful country in Greece!</p>

			<h2>My family</h2>
			<p>The city of Athens became my new home. My new family immediately fell in love with me and spoiled me a lot. I like to spend time together. I love long walks and meeting other dogs.</p>

			<p> On my first birthday, they gave me a surprise and had a meat cake that I ate quickly.I have a very good talent - sad, hungry eyes. When I look with my sad eyes, people always share their food with me. Of course, then my mother scolds me and says that this is not allowed, but sometimes she breaks her word and shares sweets with me.</p>
